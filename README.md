reutils
-------
This is reutils, a clone of busybox in Rust.

Not much is implemented yet, but feel free to contribute!

TODO
====
- [ ] Implement whatever utilities busybox does (including a shell, etc)
- [ ] Proper version support (build script?)
- [ ] We could probably handle errors better, in a more Rust-like way
- [ ] `--install` flag
- [ ] Way to list the path of all utilities
